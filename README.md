## Overview


This project is a JavaScript implementation of the popular game [rock-paper-scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors). It was built as a part of the **[Chingu Solo Project](https://www.chingu.io/)** and [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) Foundation Course.
The project's **UI** was created based on a **figma design** provided by [Frontend Mentors](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).<br>

The game allows users to play against the computer, and includes features such as a scoring system, feedback after each round, and user input validation.<br>

**Overall,** the project aims to provide a fun and engaging way to play rock-paper-scissors in a browser-based application, while also demonstrating proficiency in JavaScript and front-end web development.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser _(optional)_
- **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer _(optional)_
